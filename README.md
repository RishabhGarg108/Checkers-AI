# Checkers-AI
This is the implementation of Checkers game using pygame.
The AI implemented uses the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to play.

<p>The white player is the AI and the black player is the human player. Its the human that has the first move (because I am biased towards humans ;)).</p>

<p>Give it a shot and see if you can beat a computer!</p>

## Dependencies
The whole code is written in python3 and the only dependecy it has is the [`pygame`](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) library.
